## Michael Dawson's CV (Curriculum Vitae)

This repository hosts my work-in-progress CV. 
I converted my old résumé and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkdjr/) info into a [`.yaml`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file, and I'm working on creating a [Typst](https://typst.app/) template to render it all fancy-like as a PDF.
